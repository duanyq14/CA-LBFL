--Demo:

run 'demo.m' to test on FERET set using pre-learned CA-LBFL parameters (R=3)

--MATLAB FUNCTIONS:

extractFeature.m :  Extract face representations based on CA-LBFL

calbfl_train.m : Train W and D for CA-LBFL

calbfl_test.m : Extract CA-LBFL features for each face image

calbfl.mat : pre-learned CA-LBFL parameters.
